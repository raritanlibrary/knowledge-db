Under **`Events`**, you will be able to see certain type of clicked links activated on the website.

To get monthly totals:
- **Catalog Clicks** - Add the totals of any value that is prefixed with **`catalog-`**. Note that this is not the actual number of times the RPL Catalog has been accessed- only how many times people have been redirected to it from our website.
- **BookIt!** - Add the totals of any value that is prefixed with **`bookit-`**.
- **ABCMouse.com** - The number next to the **`abcmouse`** event. If it does not appear, assume the number of clicks was 0 for that month.

## Wi-Fi

> *Since the installation of the Main firewall, it isn't possible to get access to the exact number. This is an estimate calculated based on historical data.*

Near the middle of the website, see the section titled **`Referrers`**.

Take note of the number next to the entry for **`publicwireless.mainlib.org`**. If you add this with the number of sign-ins for computer use, and multiply this sum by 2, you can get an approximate number of Wi-Fi logins over the period of one month.
